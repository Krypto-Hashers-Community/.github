  KHC is a private group for developers who want to work together, try new ideas, and build useful open-source projects. To keep the community strong and focused, we only invite people who show real interest. If you want to join, please tell us a little about yourself — why you want to be part of KHC, how you work with computers and technology, and any projects or work you have done recently. We will review your message to make sure you’re a good fit for our group. We look forward to meeting developers who are excited to learn, build, and grow with us. If you want to apply or ask questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kryptohasherscommunity@gmail.com">kryptohasherscommunity@gmail.com</a>. Join the conversation on <a href="https://discord.gg/H9xJxb9rzG">Discord</a> and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/krypto-hashers-community/">LinkedIn</a>.
